# fPhysics
fphysics is a lightweight and straightforward physics library for raylib, consisting of approximately 500 lines of code.

This library is designed for developers who want an easy-to-use physics solution for their simple projects like Asteroids clone and other simple 2D games.

### Features
- Rigidbodies: Create and simulate rigidbodies from convex polygons.
- Collision and Friction Simulation: Handle realistic physics interactions.
- Anchors: Utilize anchors for fixed points in the simulation.
- Customizable Simulation Control: Full control over how the simulation runs.
### Limitations
- Bounding Boxes: Not currently supported.
- Ray Intersections: Not implemented.
- Optimizations: No support for spatial hashing or other advanced optimizations.
